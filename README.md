# Echoes of the Canopy

> "System Breach Detected. Reallocating User Consciousness..."

## The Story

You were a grey-hat hacker, fingers dancing across the keyboard in a dim room. Your target: **Aetheria Dynamics**, a shadow corporation rumored to be experimenting with digital-physical transmutations. You were attempting to tamper with their central mainframe to expose their secrets.

You bypassed the final firewall. You hit *Enter*.

Then, the monitor didn't just glitch—reality did. The hum of your server rack was replaced by the rustle of leaves. The smell of ozone turned into the scent of damp earth.

You woke up here. It looks like a forest, but it feels... simulated. The horizon is perfect. The silence is heavy. You are no longer in your room. You are trapped in a **Liminal Space**—a defensive construct generated by the computer you tried to hack.

To wake up, you must survive, explore the infinite anomaly, and find the glitches in the system.

## The Anomalies
*   **The Barrier:** The world isn't endless; it has boundaries.
*   **The Door:** Occasionally, a black, flat rectangular "door" will manifest on the barriers of reality. It has no depth, no handle. It is a portal through the code. Stepping through it is the only way to traverse the layers of this digital purgatory.

## Gameplay
*   **Survival:** Manage your biological needs (Hunger, Health, Stamina) within the simulation.
*   **Crafting:** The system renders primitive objects like rocks and sticks. Use them to create tools.
*   **AI Narrator:** The system observes you. Using the Gemini API, the game narrates your journey and examines objects with a mysterious, melancholic tone.

## Survival Tips

### Health & Hunger System
*   **Mushrooms Are Life-Savers:** Eating mushrooms instantly restores **+15 hunger** and can trigger health regeneration. Always keep some in your inventory for emergencies!
*   **Health Regeneration:** When your hunger is above **90%**, your health will slowly regenerate over time. Stay well-fed to heal naturally.
*   **Starvation Warning:** If hunger drops to **0**, you'll start losing health rapidly. Don't let yourself starve!
*   **Smart Inventory Management:** Save mushrooms in your inventory instead of eating them immediately. You never know when you'll need that emergency heal.

### Resource Management
*   **Collect Everything:** Gather sticks and rocks to craft essential tools and weapons
*   **Lantern Usage:** Press **Q** (or use the lantern button on mobile) to illuminate dark areas and see better at night
*   **Sprint Wisely:** Double-tap **W** to sprint, but remember it drains stamina quickly. Use it strategically!

### Exploration
*   **Mysterious Doors:** Black rectangular portals appear randomly on reality barriers—interact with them to teleport to new areas
*   **Bush Searching:** Search bushes to find berries and sticks. Some bushes contain red or blue berries!
*   **AI Observation:** The system's AI narrator watches your journey and provides cryptic commentary on your actions
