> "System Breach Detected. Reallocating User Consciousness..."

## The Story

You were a grey-hat hacker, fingers dancing across the keyboard in a dim room. Your target: **Aetheria Dynamics**, a shadow corporation rumored to be experimenting with digital-physical transmutations. You were attempting to tamper with their central mainframe to expose their secrets.

You bypassed the final firewall. You hit *Enter*.

Then, the monitor didn't just glitch—reality did. The hum of your server rack was replaced by the rustle of leaves. The smell of ozone turned into the scent of damp earth.

You woke up here. It looks like a forest, but it feels... simulated. The horizon is perfect. The silence is heavy. You are no longer in your room. You are trapped in a **Liminal Space**—a defensive construct generated by the computer you tried to hack.

To wake up, you must survive, explore the infinite anomaly, and find the glitches in the system.

## The Anomalies
*   **The Barrier:** The world isn't endless; it has boundaries.
*   **The Door:** Occasionally, a black, flat rectangular "door" will manifest on the barriers of reality. It has no depth, no handle. It is a portal through the code. Stepping through it is the only way to traverse the layers of this digital purgatory.

## Gameplay
*   **Survival:** Manage your biological needs (Hunger, Health, Stamina) within the simulation.
*   **Crafting:** The system renders primitive objects like rocks and sticks. Use them to create tools.
*   **AI Narrator:** The system observes you. Using the Gemini API, the game narrates your journey and examines objects with a mysterious, melancholic tone.
